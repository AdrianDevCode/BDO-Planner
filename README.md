BDO Gear Calculator
========

A gear/equipment calculator for Black Desert Online ([Demo Here](https://www.sirmre.com/bdo-gear-calculator)).


## Status

The code should work, but the item database is being built (this is the boring and time consuming part). The missing items are primarity Main and Off hand weapons (only added few berserker weapons for testing).
