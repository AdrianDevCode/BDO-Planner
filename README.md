BDO Gear Calculator
========

A gear/equipment calculator for Black Desert Online ([Demo Here](https://shadowtrance.github.io)).


## Current Version: 0.3.3.5

See [the changelog](https://github.com/Shadowtrance/BDO-Gear-Calculator/blob/update/CHANGELOG.md) for details.


## Status

The following data/features are still outstanding/being developed.

  - Add non-conbat related gems and gear (like fishing and crafting items).
  - Missing enhancement information for items (purely visually).
  - Due to copyright reasons, I cannot include any materials like item icons (as it would be considered distribution of copyrigted material). However I will investigate what options I have.


## Hidden Stats

Hidden stats (like accuracy increase on Yuria) will not be included in the calculation as I don't know where I can find information on how it scales.
