BDO Planner
========

## About

A character planner for Black Desert Online. Originally started as a gear/equipment calculator by [MrEliasen](https://github.com/MrEliasen), it was updated heavily and grown on to create a full character planner by [Ihm](https://github.com/Ihellmasker) and [Shadowtrance](https://github.com/Shadowtrance).

The current live version of the planner can be accessed at [BDOPlanner.com](http://www.bdoplanner.com).

Any features we're currently testing can be found on the Beta site [Beta.BDOPlanner.com](http://beta.bdoplanner.com) but there's no promises it'll actually work!

## Current Version: 1.0.0

The Changelog can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Ihellmasker/BDO-Planner/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Support and Feedback

More information coming soon.
